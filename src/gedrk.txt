 Add a subtle, transparent glow or another visual cue around the poster's edges to indicate it's clickable
 Layered Firewall: Instead of a single padlock or firewall, use a layered design. Imagine three semi-transparent, concentric circles representing the three aspects of the CIA triad.
Inner layer (Confidentiality): This layer could be a stylized padlock graphic with a checkmark inside, signifying secure access.
Middle layer (Integrity): This layer could showcase a document with a verification stamp or a "shield" icon with a checkmark, symbolizing data integrity.
Outer layer (Availability): This layer could depict a globe with network connections or a server icon with a checkmark, representing accessible information.
